##About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on Customer Tenure rate from [Telecom Customer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from: 
1. [Data Cleaning]

##Problem Definition
-Can we find the variables that have the strongest relationship with Customer Tenure?
-Can we produce a model that can accurately predict customer tenure based on certain variables?

##Models Used
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision trees
3. XG Boosting
4. Gradient Boosting
5. Random Forest

##Conclusion
-The top 6 variables of differing natures are found.
-A model with a prediction accuracy of 99.7% can be produced with random forest.
-Coding w the bros is fun.
