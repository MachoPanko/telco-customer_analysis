## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on Customer Tenure rate from [Telecom Customer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from: 
1. [Data Cleaning]
2. [Data Preparation]
3. [Data Resampling and Splitting]
4. [Machine Learning]

## Problem Definition
- Can we find the variables that have the strongest relationship with Customer Tenure?
- Can we produce a model that can accurately predict customer tenure based on certain variables?

## Models Used
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision trees
3. XG Boosting
4. Gradient Boosting
5. Random Forest

## Conclusion
- The top 6 variables of differing natures are found.
- A model with a prediction accuracy of 99.7% can be produced with random forest.
- We learned that linear regression and decision tree regression did not perform well in predicting tenure.
- We learnt three new machine learning models (random forest, XGBoost and gradient boosting) which offers way more accurate results.
